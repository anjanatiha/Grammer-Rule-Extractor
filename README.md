Extracted from the BROWN file all grammar rules embedded in parse trees.
(Did not consider punctuation as a nonterminal and eliminated numbers attached to non-terminals such as '-1', '-2', etc.)
Reported the following:
	number of distinct rules found.
	the 10 most frequent rules regardless of the non-terminal on the left-hand side
	the non-terminal with the most alternate rules (i.e. the non-terminal that can have most diverse structures).
	Estimated the above grammar size if lexicalized(i.e. to add head words to some of the rules).
